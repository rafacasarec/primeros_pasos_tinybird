    A drop-in replacement for threading.locals that also works with asyncio
    Tasks (via the current_task asyncio method), and passes locals through
    sync_to_async and async_to_sync.
    Specifically:
     - Locals work per-coroutine on any thread not spawned using asgiref
     - Locals work per-thread on any thread not spawned using asgiref
     - Locals are shared with the parent coroutine when using sync_to_async
     - Locals are shared with the parent thread when using async_to_sync
       (and if that thread was launched using sync_to_async, with its parent
       coroutine as well, with this working for indefinite levels of nesting)
    Set thread_critical to True to not allow locals to pass from an async Task
    to a thread it spawns. This is needed for code that truly needs
    thread-safety, as opposed to things used for helpful context (e.g. sqlite
    does not like being called from a different thread to the one it is from).
    Thread-critical code will still be differentiated per-Task within a thread
    as it is expected it does not like concurrent access.
    This doesn't use contextvars as it needs to support 3.6. Once it can support
    3.7 only, we can then reimplement the storage more nicely.

class SyncToAsync:
    """
    Utility class which turns a synchronous callable into an awaitable that
    runs in a threadpool. It also sets a threadlocal inside the thread so
    calls to AsyncToSync can escape it.
    If thread_sensitive is passed, the code will run in the same thread as any
    outer code. This is needed for underlying Python code that is not
    threadsafe (for example, code which handles SQLite database connections).
    If the outermost program is async (i.e. SyncToAsync is outermost), then
    this will be a dedicated single sub-thread that all sync code runs in,
    one after the other. If the outermost program is sync (i.e. AsyncToSync is
    outermost), this will just be the main thread. This is achieved by idling
    with a CurrentThreadExecutor while AsyncToSync is blocking its sync parent,
    rather than just blocking.
    If executor is passed in, that will be used instead of the loop's default executor.
    In order to pass in an executor, thread_sensitive must be set to False, otherwise
    a TypeError will be raised.
